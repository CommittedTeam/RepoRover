+Designed for instructors who want an alternative to simple scripts or
+stand-alone platforms that do not integrate with infrastructure like GitHub and
+Travis CI, GatorGrader is a tool that automatically checks the work of technical
+writers and programmers. Unlike other tools, GatorGrader provides a "batteries
+included" approach to automated grading that makes it easy for instructors to
+combine existing checks for projects implemented in a wide variety of
+programming languages. GatorGrader's developers take its engineering seriously,
+maintaining standards-compliant source code, a test suite with 100% statement
+and branch coverage, and top-notch source code and user documentation.
